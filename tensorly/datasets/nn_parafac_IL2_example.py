"""
Non-negative PARAFAC Decomposition of IL-2 Response Data
==============================

Here we will provide an example of how to use non-negative PARAFAC tensor 
decomposition (:func:`tensorly.decomposition.parafac`) to both reduce the dimensionality 
of a tensor of experimental data, as well as make insights regarding the underlying structure 
of that data.

To do this, we will work with a tensor of experimentally measured cell signaling data.

#%%
# Here we will load a tensor of experimentally measured cellular responses to 
# IL-2 stimulation. IL-2 is a naturally occurring immune signaling molecule 
# which has been engineered and mutated in attempts to alter its signaling activity, 
# and increase or decrease its interactions with particular cell types. 
# Here, our data contains the responses of 8 different cell types to 13 different 
# IL-2 mutants, at 4 different timepoints, at 12 standardized IL-2 concentrations.
# 
# Therefore, our tensor will have shape (13 x 4 x 12 x 8), with dimensions
# representing IL-2 mutant, stimulation time, dose, and cell type respectively.


responseData = IL2data()
IL2mutants, cells = responseData.ligands, responseData.cells
print(responseData.tensor.shape, responseData.dims)

#%%
# IL-2 mutants, at 4 different timepoints, at 12 standardized IL-2 concentrations.
# Now we will run non-negative PARAFAC tensor decomposition to reduce the dimensionality 
# of our tensor. We will use 3 components, and normalize our resulting tensor to aid in 
# future comparisons of correlations across components.


tensorFact = non_negative_parafac(np.nan_to_num(responseData.tensor), init='random', rank=3, mask=np.isfinite(responseData.tensor), n_iter_max=5000, tol=1e-9, random_state=1)
tensorFact.normalize()

#%%
# Now we will load the names of our cell types and IL-2 mutants, in the order in which 
# they are present in our original tensor. IL-2 mutant names refer to the specific 
# mutations made to their amino acid sequence, as well as their valency 
# format (monovalent or bivalent).
# 
# Finally, we label, plot, and analyze our factored tensor of data.

#%%
# Here we observe the correlations which both ligands and cell types have with each of 
# our three components - we can interepret our tensor factorization for looking for 
# patterns among these correlations. 
# 
# For example, we can see that bivalent mutants generally have higher correlations with
# component two, as do regulatory T cells. Thus we can infer that bivalent ligands 
# activate regulatory T cells more than monovalent ligands. We also see that this 
# relationship is strengthened by the availability of IL2RÎ±, one subunit of the IL-2 receptor.

# This is just one example of an insight we can make using tensor factorization. 
# By plotting the correlations which time and dose have with each component, we 
# could additionally make inferences as to the dynamics and dose dependence of how mutations 
# affect IL-2 signaling in immune cells.
